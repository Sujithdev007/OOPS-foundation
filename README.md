this is for learning the foundation of oops in java


# Final for variables
//Final keyword as variable => wont change

# Final for methods
//final method cant be changed , basically the method is frozen which means no child class able to inherit
an cannot be overriden

# Final for classes
//final class wont be able to inherited eg: String class (the developers who developed they are not intersted in chaning the way the string class works)


# Abstract 

the use of Abstract is to maintain a methods body to used later part of the class which gets interits 

We can create only reference for Abstract class not object

Vechile V ; this is fine 
Vechile V = new Vechile(); this is not fine actually because its incomplete class

# Note -> Child class of abstract class is also incomplete because of the parent abstract class   
# either complete the incomplete the thing or else make the child class as abstract so now u are unble 
# to create objects for this class also
